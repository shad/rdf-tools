Here are additional considerations for the RDF layer:

## Error Recovery & Resilience

**Partial Parsing Strategy**
How to handle files with multiple turtle blocks where some parse successfully and others fail. Should you keep the good triples and mark the bad blocks, or fail the entire file? Consider a "best effort" approach with detailed error reporting.

**Transaction Management**
When updating a file with multiple turtle blocks, ensure atomicity. If parsing one block fails, should you rollback changes to other blocks in the same file? Consider implementing a transaction-like system for graph updates.

**Graceful Degradation**
Design fallback behaviors when RDF libraries fail, when queries time out, or when memory limits are hit. The plugin should remain functional even if some operations fail.

## Memory & Resource Management

**Graph Lifecycle Management**
Strategy for loading/unloading graphs based on usage patterns. Should rarely-accessed graphs be serialized to disk? How do you handle graph eviction from memory without losing user work?

**Streaming vs Batch Processing**
For large turtle blocks or query results, consider streaming approaches. N3.js supports streaming parsing, and Comunica supports result streaming - plan for when these become necessary.

**Resource Cleanup**
Ensure proper cleanup of Comunica query engines, N3 stores, and other resources. Consider implementing a resource pool pattern for expensive objects.

## Extensibility & Future Proofing

**Plugin Architecture**
Design the RDF layer to be extensible - you might want custom SPARQL functions, different serialization formats, or integration with external SPARQL endpoints later.

**Schema Validation Layer**
Plan for future SHACL or other schema validation. Your models should accommodate validation results and constraint violations.

**Import/Export Abstractions**
Design interfaces for different RDF serialization formats (JSON-LD, RDF/XML, etc.) and external data sources, even if you only implement Turtle initially.

## Integration Boundaries

**Obsidian API Isolation**
Keep Obsidian-specific code separate from pure RDF operations. Your RDF services should work independently and be testable without Obsidian running.

**Event System Design**
Plan how the RDF layer communicates changes back to the Obsidian plugin layer. Consider using an event bus or observer pattern rather than tight coupling.

**Async/Await Strategy**
All RDF operations should be properly async to avoid blocking Obsidian's UI. Plan your async boundaries carefully, especially for operations that might take significant time.

## Data Integrity & Consistency

**URI Canonicalization**
Establish rules for how URIs are normalized and compared. Different representations of the same URI (relative vs absolute, encoded vs decoded) should be handled consistently.

**Namespace Consistency**
Plan for handling namespace evolution - what happens when users change global prefixes or when the same prefix means different things in different files?

**Change Detection**
Beyond file modification times, consider content-based change detection using hashes to avoid unnecessary reprocessing when files are touched but not actually changed.

## Developer Experience

**Debugging Infrastructure**
Build in logging, query explain plans, and introspection capabilities. Developers (including yourself) will need visibility into what the RDF layer is doing.

**Serialization/Deserialization**
Plan for how complex RDF objects get serialized for caching, debugging, or inter-service communication. JSON-LD might be useful here.

**Configuration Management**
Design how RDF-layer configuration (query timeouts, cache sizes, parsing options) gets managed and validated.

These considerations will help you build a robust foundation that can grow with the plugin's complexity while maintaining good performance and reliability.
