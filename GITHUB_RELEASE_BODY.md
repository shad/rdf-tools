## üêõ Critical Bug Fix: SPARQL Default Prefix Recognition

Fixed a critical bug where **user-defined global prefixes** configured in settings were not recognized during SPARQL query execution, causing "Unknown prefix" errors.

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ Custom prefixes (like `shad:`, `ex:`, etc.) defined in settings now work correctly in SPARQL queries
- ‚úÖ PREFIX declarations are automatically injected into queries before execution
- ‚úÖ All global prefixes from settings are properly recognized by the SPARQL engine

### Example
If you have `shad: https://shadr.us/ns/` in your settings, this query now works:
```sparql
SELECT ?name WHERE {
    shad:alice foaf:name ?name .
}
```
