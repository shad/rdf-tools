# RDF Tools for Obsidian

An Obsidian plugin that enables working with RDF data and SPARQL queries directly within your vault. Transform your notes into a queryable knowledge graph using Turtle code blocks and live-updating SPARQL results.

## Features

- üê¢ **Turtle Code Blocks** - Write RDF data directly in markdown using `turtle` code blocks
- üîç **SPARQL Queries** - Execute SPARQL queries against your RDF data with `sparql` code blocks
- ‚ö° **Live Updates** - Query results automatically update when underlying turtle data changes
- üóÇÔ∏è **Named Graphs** - Each file becomes a named graph with URI scheme `vault://path/filename.md`
- üè∑Ô∏è **Prefix Management** - Global and file-local prefix support with intelligent merging
- üìä **Result Formatting** - Table, list, count, and custom formatting options for query results

## Example Usage

### Turtle Data Block
````markdown
```turtle
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix : <vault://people/contacts.md/> .

:alice a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Alice Smith" ;
    foaf:knows :bob .

:bob a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Bob Jones" .
```
````

### SPARQL Query Block
````markdown
```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?name WHERE {
    ?person a foaf:Person ;
            foaf:name ?name .
}
```
````

## Architecture

RDF Tools follows a layered architecture designed for performance, testability, and extensibility:

### Core Services
- **GraphService** - Graph storage and management using N3.js
- **QueryService** - SPARQL execution with Comunica engine
- **ParsingService** - Turtle syntax parsing and validation
- **PrefixService** - Namespace and prefix management
- **DependencyService** - Change tracking for live updates
- **CacheService** - Multi-level caching for performance

### URI Resolution
- Base URI: `@base <vault://path/filename.md/>` for each file
- Named graphs: `<vault://path/filename.md>` for graph identification
- Global queries: `<vault://>` queries across all files in vault
- Directory queries: `<vault://folder/>` queries all files in folder

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (for package management)

### Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rdf-tools
npm install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with watch mode
npm run build        # Production build

# Code Quality  
npm run check-all    # Run all quality checks (recommended before commits)
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check formatting without fixing
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
```

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts                 # Plugin entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/              # Core RDF processing services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/               # Data models and interfaces  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                   # Obsidian UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                # Helper utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/                # TypeScript definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/            # Test files
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** - Individual services with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests** - Service interactions with real RDF libraries
- **Plugin Tests** - Obsidian integration with mocked APIs

## Installation

### Manual Installation (Development)
1. Clone this repository to your vault's plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/
   git clone <repository-url> rdf-tools
   cd rdf-tools
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

2. Enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins

### From Community Plugin Store
*Coming soon - plugin will be submitted to community store after beta testing*

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **N3.js** - RDF parsing, serialization, and triple store
- **Comunica** - SPARQL query execution engine  
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **esbuild** - Fast bundling for development and production

### Performance Features
- **Lazy Loading** - Graphs loaded on-demand
- **Incremental Updates** - Only reprocess changed content
- **Smart Caching** - Multi-level cache with intelligent invalidation
- **Background Processing** - Heavy operations don't block UI

### Security & Privacy
- **Local Processing** - All RDF operations happen locally within your vault
- **No Network Requests** - Completely offline operation by default
- **Vault Isolation** - Plugin only accesses files within the current vault
- **Resource Limits** - Query timeouts and memory usage controls
