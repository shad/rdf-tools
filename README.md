# RDF Tools

Transform your Obsidian vault into a semantic knowledge graph! Write RDF data in Turtle format and query it with SPARQL - all within your notes.

## What it does

- 📝 Write **RDF data** using `turtle` code blocks in your notes
- 🔍 **Query your data** with `sparql` code blocks that show live results
- ⚡ **Automatic updates** - query results refresh when you change the data
- 🔗 **Cross-file queries** - query data from multiple notes at once
- 🏷️ **Smart namespaces** - built-in prefixes for common vocabularies

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin from the Community Plugins store
2. Create a note and add a turtle code block with some RDF data
3. Add a sparql code block to query that data
4. Watch the query results appear automatically!

## Simple Example

Create RDF data about people you know:

### Turtle Data Block
````markdown
```turtle
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix : <vault://people/contacts.md/> .

:alice a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Alice Smith" ;
    foaf:knows :bob .

:bob a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Bob Jones" .
```
````

### SPARQL Query Block
````markdown
```sparql
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?name WHERE {
    ?person a foaf:Person ;
            foaf:name ?name .
}
```
````

## Cross-File Queries

Query data from other files using `FROM` clauses:

````markdown
```sparql
SELECT ?person ?name
FROM <vault://people/contacts.md>
WHERE {
    ?person a foaf:Person ;
            foaf:name ?name .
}
```
````

The results automatically update when you change the data in `contacts.md`!

## How it works

### File = Graph
Each markdown file with turtle blocks becomes a named graph:
- `vault://path/file.md` - refers to a specific file
- `vault://folder/` - queries all files in a folder
- `vault://` - queries all files in your vault

### URI Resolution
Use relative URIs within files, absolute URIs across files:
```turtle
@base <vault://people/contacts.md/> .
<alice> foaf:name "Alice" .          # becomes vault://people/contacts.md/alice
```
